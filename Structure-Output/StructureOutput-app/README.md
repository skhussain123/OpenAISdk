# Output types
By default, agents produce plain text (i.e. str) outputs. If you want the agent to produce a particular type of output, you can use the output_type parameter. A common choice is to use Pydantic objects, but we support any type that can be wrapped in a Pydantic TypeAdapter - dataclasses, lists, TypedDict, etc.
