## Handoffs
Handoffs allow an agent to delegate tasks to another agent. This is particularly useful in scenarios where different agents specialize in distinct areas. For example, a customer support app might have agents that each specifically handle tasks like order status, refunds, FAQs, etc.

Handoffs are represented as tools to the LLM. So if there's a handoff to an agent named Refund Agent, the tool would be called transfer_to_refund_agent.
