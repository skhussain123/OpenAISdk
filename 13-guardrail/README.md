### Guardrails
Guardrails run in parallel to your agents, enabling you to do checks and validations of user input. For example, imagine you have an agent that uses a very smart (and hence slow/expensive) model to help with customer requests. You wouldn't want malicious users to ask the model to help them with their math homework. So, you can run a guardrail with a fast/cheap model. If the guardrail detects malicious usage, it can immediately raise an error, which stops the expensive model from running and saves you time/money.

#### There are two kinds of guardrails:
1. Input guardrails run on the initial user input
2. Output guardrails run on the final agent output
