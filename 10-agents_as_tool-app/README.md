Interestingly, you can turn other agents into tools. This allows one agent to call another for assistance without fully handing off control. The orchestrator agent uses the other agents as a tool, depending on the userâ€™s request, while retaining oversight.

The as_tool method in OpenAI's Agents SDK allows you to transform an Agent instance into a callable tool that other agents can utilize. This feature facilitates the creation of modular and interactive AI systems where agents can delegate tasks among themselves.

#### This is different from handoffs in two ways:

* In handoffs, the new agent receives the conversation history. In this tool, the new agent receives generated input.
* In handoffs, the new agent takes over the conversation. In this tool, the new agent is called as a tool, and the conversation is continued by the original agent.

### Key Concepts:
1. Agents: Autonomous entities equipped with instructions and tools to perform specific tasks.
2. Tools: Functions or capabilities that agents can invoke to accomplish tasks.
3. Handoffs: Mechanisms enabling agents to delegate tasks to other agents.


##### Using the as_tool Method:
o utilize the as_tool method, you can follow these steps:
 
##### 1. Define Individual Agents:
Create agents with specific roles and instructions.
