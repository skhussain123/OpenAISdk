## What is OpenRouter?
OpenRouter is a service that provides a single unified API to access multiple large language models (LLMs) from different providers like OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google Gemini, and others. Instead of managing separate API keys and endpoints for each AI model, you can use OpenRouter’s API to seamlessly switch between and use various AI models through one interface.


## Key points:

* Unified access to many AI models.
* Simplifies API management — one key, one endpoint.
* Supports popular models like GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and more.
* Allows easy switching between models without changing your code much.
* Often more cost-effective and flexible for developers.
